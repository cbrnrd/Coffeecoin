# What is Coffeecoin?
Coffeecoin is a cryptocurrency based on secure blockchain technology. Coffeecoin uses peer-to-peer networking to keep payments secure and without a central authority. Coffeecoin Core (this repo) is the name of the open source software backend which enables the use of this currency.
