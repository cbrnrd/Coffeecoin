# What is Coffeecoin?
Coffeecoin is a cryptocurrency based on secure blockchain technology. Coffeecoin uses peer-to-peer networking to keep payments secure and without a central authority. Coffeecoin Core (this repo) is the name of the open source software backend which enables the use of this currency.

# Running your own node.
Since Coffeecoin is built using Java, the node can be run on Linux, Windows, or macOS. Just clone the source and run your operating system's startup script
